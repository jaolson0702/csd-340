            I enjoy coding because I like organizing information using logic and
            performing calculations with data.

          <p>
            I enjoy researching my family's genealogy because I like to make
            connections between people and find ways to input and organize
            information that relates them.

          <p>
            I am interested in writing stories because I have seen different
            ways stories have been organized and how the events have been put
            together, and I try to apply that to my desire to organize
            information.
